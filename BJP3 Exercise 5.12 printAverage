/* Write a method named printAverage that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and repeatedly prompts the user for numbers. Once any number less than zero is typed, the average of all non-negative numbers typed is displayed. Display the average as a double, and do not round it. For example, a call to your method might look like this:


Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);
printAverage(console);
The following is one example log of execution for your method:

Type a number: 7
Type a number: 4
Type a number: 16
Type a number: -4
Average was 9.0
If the first number typed is negative, do not print an average. For example:

Type a number: -2
*/

public static void printAverage(Scanner input){
    boolean noNeg = true;
    int sum = 0;
    int totalNumbers = 0;
    while(noNeg){
        System.out.print("Type a number: ");
        int newNum = input.nextInt();
        if (newNum < 0){
            noNeg = false;
        }else{
            sum += newNum;
            totalNumbers++;
        }
    }
    if(totalNumbers > 0){
        double average = (double) sum / totalNumbers;
        System.out.print("Average was " + average);
    }
}
