/* Write a method named gcd that accepts two integers as parameters and returns
the greatest common divisor of the two numbers. The greatest common divisor (GCD)
of two integers a and b is the largest integer that is a factor of both a and b. 
The GCD of any number and 1 is 1, and the GCD of any number and 0 is that number.

One efficient way to compute the GCD of two numbers is to use Euclid's algorithm,
which states the following:

GCD(A, B) = GCD(B, A % B) 
GCD(A, 0) = Absolute value of A

In other words, if you repeatedly mod A by B and then swap the two values, 
eventually B will store 0 and A will store the greatest common divisor.
