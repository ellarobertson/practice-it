/* Write a method named hopscotch that accepts an integer parameter for a number
of "hops" and prints a hopscotch board of that many hops. A "hop" is defined as 
the split into two numbers and then back together again into one. For example, 
hopscotch(3); should print:

   1
2     3
   4
5     6
   7
8     9
   10
