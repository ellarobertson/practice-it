/* Write a method named monthApart that accepts four integer parameters representing
two calendar dates. Each date consists of a month (1 through 12) and a day (1 through 
the number of days in that month [28-31]). The method returns whether the dates are at
least a month apart. Assume that all dates in this problem occur during the same year.
For example, the following dates are all considered to be at least a month apart from
9/19 (September 19): 2/14, 7/25, 8/2, 8/19, 10/19, 10/20, and 11/5. The following dates
are NOT at least a month apart from 9/19: 9/20, 9/28, 10/1, 10/15, and 10/18. Note that
the first date could come before or after (or be the same as) the second date. Assume
that all parameter values passed are valid.
