/* Write a method named makeGuesses that will guess numbers between 1 and 50 inclusive until it
makes a guess of at least 48. It should report each guess and at the end should report the total
number of guesses made. Below is a sample execution:

guess = 47
guess = 45
guess = 27
guess = 49
total guesses = 5
