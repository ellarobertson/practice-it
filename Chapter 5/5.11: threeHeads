/* Write a method named threeHeads that repeatedly flips a coin until three heads in a row are seen. 
You should use a Random object to give an equal chance to a head or a tail appearing. Each time the coin
is flipped, what is seen is displayed (H for heads, T for tails). When 3 heads in a row are flipped a 
congratulatory message is printed. Here are possible outputs of two calls to threeHeads:

T T T H T H H H
Three heads in a row!
