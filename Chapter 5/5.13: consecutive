/* Write a method named consecutive that accepts three integers as parameters and returns true if they are three 
consecutive numbers; that is, if the numbers can be arranged into an order such that there is some integer k such
that the parameters' values are k, k+1, and k+2. Your method should return false if the integers are not consecutive.
Note that order is not significant; your method should return the same result for the same three integers passed 
in any order.
