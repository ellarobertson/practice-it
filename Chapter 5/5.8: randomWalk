/* Write a method named randomWalk that performs a random one-dimensional walk, reporting each position reached 
and the maximum position reached during the walk. The random walk should begin at position 0. On each step, you
should either increase or decrease the position by 1 (with equal probability). The walk stops when 3 or -3 is hit.
The output should look like this:

position = 0
position = 1
position = 0
position = -1
position = -2
position = -1
position = -2
position = -3
max position = 1

        int change = rand.nextInt(2)+1;
