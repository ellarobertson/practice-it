/*Write a method called printPowersOf2 that accepts a maximum number as an argument and prints each power of 2 from 20 (1) up to that maximum power, inclusive. For example, consider the following calls:


printPowersOf2(3);
printPowersOf2(10);
These calls should produce the following output:

1 2 4 8
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
You may assume that the value passed to printPowersOf2 is 0 or greater.
