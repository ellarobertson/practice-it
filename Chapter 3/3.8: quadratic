/*Write a method called quadratic that solves quadratic equations and prints their roots.
Your method should accept the coefficients a, b, and c as parameters and should print the roots of the equation.
You may assume that the equation has two real roots, though mathematically this is not always the case.

Also, there should be two roots, one the result of the addition, the other, the result of the subtraction. 
Print the root resulting from the addition first.
