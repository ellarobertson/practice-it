/* Write a method called processName that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and that 
prompts the user to enter his or her full name, then prints the name in reverse order (
i.e., last name, first name). You may assume that only a first and last name will be given.
Here is a sample dialogue with the user:

Please enter your full name: Sammy Jankis
Your name in reverse order is Jankis, Sammy
*/

public static void processName(Scanner name){
    System.out.print("Please enter your full name: ");
    String first = name.next();
    String last = name.next();
    System.out.print("Your name in reverse order is " + last + ", " + first);
