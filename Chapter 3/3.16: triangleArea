/* Write a method called triangleArea that accepts the three side lengths of a triangle 
(all real numbers) as parameters and returns the area of a triangle with those side lengths.
For example, the call triangleArea(8, 5.2, 7.1) should return 18.151176098258745. 
To compute the area, use Heron's formula.
