/*Write a method padString that accepts two parameters: a String and an integer representing a length. 
The method should pad the parameter string with spaces until its length is the given length.
For example, padString("hello", 8) should return "   hello". 
If the string's length is already at least as long as the length parameter, your method should return the 
original string. For example, padString("congratulations", 10) would return "congratulations".
