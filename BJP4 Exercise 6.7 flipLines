/* Write a method named flipLines that accepts as its parameter a Scanner for an input file and
that writes to the console the same file's contents with successive pairs of lines reversed in order. 

A line can be blank. An input file can have an odd number of lines, in which case the last line is 
printed in its original position. You may not make any assumptions about how many lines are in the 
Scanner.
