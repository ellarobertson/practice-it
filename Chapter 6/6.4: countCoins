/* Write a method named countCoins that accepts as its parameter a Scanner for an
input file whose data represents a person's money grouped into stacks of coins. 
Your method should add up the cash values of all the coins and print the total 
money at the end. The input consists of a series of pairs of tokens, where each
pair begins with an integer and is followed by the type of coin, which will be
either "pennies" (1 cent each), "nickels" (5 cents each), "dimes" (10 cents each),
or "quarters" (25 cents each), case-insensitively. A given coin might appear more 
than once on the same line.

You may assume that the file contains at least 1 pair of tokens. 
You may also assume that the input is valid; that the input has an even number of
tokens, that every other token is an integer, and that the others are valid coin 
types.
