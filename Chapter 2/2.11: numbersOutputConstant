/* Modify your code from the previous exercise so that it could easily be modified to display a different range
of numbers (instead of 1234567890) and a different number of repetitions of those numbers (instead of 60 total 
characters), with the vertical bars still matching up correctly. Write a complete class named NumbersOutput. 
Use two class constants instead of "magic numbers,", with one constant set to 6 for the number of repetitions,
and the other set to 10 for the range of numbers. Put the for loop code in your class's main method.
