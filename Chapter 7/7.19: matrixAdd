/* Write a method named matrixAdd that accepts a pair of two-dimensional arrays of
integers as parameters, treats the arrays as 2D matrices and adds them, returning 
the result. The sum of two matrices A and B is a matrix C where for every row i and
column j, Cij = Aij + Bij. You may assume that the arrays passed as parameters have
the same dimensions.
