/* Write a method called wordLengths that accepts a Scanner representing an input file as its argument. 
Your method should read from the given file, count the number of letters in each token in the file, and 
output a result diagram of how many words contain each number of letters. Use tabs before the asterisks
so that they'll line up. If there are no words of a given length, omit that line from the output.
