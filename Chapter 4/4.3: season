/* Write a method named season that takes two integers as parameters representing a month and day and
that returns a String indicating the season for that month and day. Assume that months are specified 
as an integer between 1 and 12 (1 for January, 2 for February, and so on) and that the day of the month
is a number between 1 and 31.

If the date falls between 12/16 and 3/15, you should return "Winter". If the date falls between 3/16
and 6/15, you should return "Spring". If the date falls between 6/16 and 9/15, you should return "Summer".
And if the date falls between 9/16 and 12/15, you should return "Fall".
