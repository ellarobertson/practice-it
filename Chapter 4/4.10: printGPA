/* Write a method named printGPA that calculates a student's grade point 
average. The user will type a line of input containing the student's name,
then a number of scores, followed by that many integer scores.
Here are two example dialogues:

Enter a student record: Maria 5 72 91 84 89 78
Maria's grade is 82.8

Enter a student record: Jordan 4 86 71 62 90
Jordan's grade is 77.25
*/

public static void printGPA(){
    System.out.print("Enter a student record: ");
    Scanner lineScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    String name = lineScanner.next();
    int totalNumOfGrades = lineScanner.nextInt();
    double totalGradePoints = 0.0;
    for(int i = 0; i < totalNumOfGrades; i++){
        totalGradePoints += lineScanner.nextInt();
    }
    System.out.println(name + "'s grade is " + (totalGradePoints/totalNumOfGrades));
}
