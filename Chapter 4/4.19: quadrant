/* Write a static method called quadrant that takes as parameters a pair of real numbers representing an
(x, y) point and that returns the quadrant number for that point. Recall that quadrants are numbered as
integers from 1 to 4 with the upper-right quadrant numbered 1 and the subsequent quadrants numbered in a 
counter-clockwise fashion.  If a point falls on the x-axis or the y-axis, then the method should return 0.
