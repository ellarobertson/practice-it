/* Add the following method to the Point class:

public double slope(Point other)

Returns the slope of the line drawn between this Point and the given other Point. Use the formula 
(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) to determine the slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Note that this
formula fails for points with identical x-coordinates, so throw an IllegalArgumentException in this case.


public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
*/

public double slope(Point other){
    if(x == other.x){
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
    return (double)(other.y - y) / (other.x - x);
}
