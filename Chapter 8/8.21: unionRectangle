/* Add the following method to your Rectangle class from the previous exercises:


public Rectangle union(Rectangle rect)
Returns a new Rectangle that represents the area occupied by the tightest bounding 
box that contains both this Rectangle and the given other Rectangle. Your method 
should not modify the current Rectangle or the one that is passed in as a parameter; 
you should create and return a new rectangle.
