/* Add the following method to the Point class:

public int quadrant()

Returns which quadrant of the x/y plane this Point object falls in. Quadrant 1 contains all points whose
x and y values are both positive. Quadrant 2 contains all points with negative x but positive y. Quadrant 3
contains all points with negative x and y values. Quadrant 4 contains all points with positive x but negative
y. If the point lies directly on the x and/or y axis, return 0.

    private int x;
    private int y;

    int quad = 0;
