/* Add the following method to your Line class:


public boolean isCollinear(Point p)
Returns true if the given point is collinear with the points of this line; that is, if, when this Line is 
stretched infinitely, it would eventually hit the given point. Points are collinear if a straight line can
be drawn that connects them. Two basic examples are three points that have the same x- or y-coordinate. 
The more general case can be determined by calculating the slope of the line between each pair of points 
and checking whether this slope is the same for all pairs of points.
