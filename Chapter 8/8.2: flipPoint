/* Add the following method to the Point class:

public void flip()

Negates and swaps the x/y coordinates of the Point object. For example, if the object initially represents the
point (5, -3), after a call to flip, the object should represent (3, -5). If the object initially represents 
the point (4, 17), after a call to flip, the object should represent (-17, -4).


public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
*/

//my code
public void flip(){
    int temp = x;
    x = -y;
    y = -temp;
}
