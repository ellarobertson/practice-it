/* Add the following method to the BankAccount class:

public String toString()

Your method should return a string that contains the account's name and balance separated by a comma 
and space. There are some special cases you should handle. If the balance is negative, put the - sign before 
the dollar sign. Also, always display the cents as a two-digit number.
