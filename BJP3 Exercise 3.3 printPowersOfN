/* Write a method called printPowersOfN that accepts a base and an exponent as arguments and prints each power of the base from base0 (1) up to that maximum power, inclusive. For example, consider the following calls:

printPowersOfN(4, 3);
printPowersOfN(5, 6);
printPowersOfN(-2, 8);
These calls should produce the following output:

1 4 16 64
1 5 25 125 625 3125 15625
1 -2 4 -8 16 -32 64 -128 256
You may assume that the exponent passed to printPowersOfN has a value of 0 or greater.
